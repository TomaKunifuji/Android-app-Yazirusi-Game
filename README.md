Hello! This is an Android game I created as part of a class project. In this game, you compete for points by pressing the buttons that match the arrows displayed at the top of the screen.


## Features:
1. This is a game where you press the button with the same arrow as the one that appears at the top of the screen!
2. Tap the arrows without making any mistakes to earn a high score!
3. When the time limit ends, the score will be displayed.

## Development Environment:
Android Studio Iguana
Java
Android SDK 31+

## Notes:
Other components are school-provided items.
